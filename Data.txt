Section1

What is animal cruelty?
Animal cruelty can be branched out into two different categories:
Neglect, or intentional cruelty. Neglect is the act of not providing the necessary care, food, water and shelter that animals and pets require.
On the other hand, intentional cruelty is the deliberate act of inflicting harm on animals and pets or having intentions of harming animals and pets

Who are your target audience?
Pet owners and the general public. 

Why do we need to know more about animal cruelty?
Our aim is to raise awareness among pet owners and the general public on the situation of animals and also to allow
a world where animals and human can coexist peacefully.

When is my help needed?
As soon as possible. The sooner you start, the more animals and pets we can rescue from starvation, dehydration, illnesses and abuse.

Great! How can I help?
- As meat consumers, we can start purchasing meat from farms who follow the humane slaughter act or become a vegetarian.
- As pet owners, we can start by paying more attention to our pets. Examples include but is not limited to: providing your pets with adequate water, food,
and shelter and ensuring your pets are healthy and illness free.
- Have time to spare? Take on voluntary work from organisations like Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).
- Witness an act of animal cruelty? If you witness an act of deliberate cruelty (resulting in injury or death) or abandonment of an animal, please:
  call the police at 999 immediately and also inform SPCA at 6287 5355 ext 9 (SPCA operates 24/7). More info: http://www.spca.org.sg/services_inspectorate.asp

One case of animal abuse is one case too many. Let us do our part in building a world where animals are treated equally as humans.
